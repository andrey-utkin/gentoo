		Biboumi is a Free, Libre and Open Source XMPP gateway that
		connects to IRC servers and translates between the two
		protocols. Its goal is to let XMPP users take part in IRC
		discussions, using their favourite XMPP client.

		It provides the following features:

		* Connection from an unlimited number of XMPP users to an
		unlimited number of IRC servers
		* Persistent connections to a configured list of channels,
		making it behave as an IRC bouncer
		* Basic channel features: join, part, view and set the topic,
		view and set channel or user modes, kick, nick change...
		* Private conversations
		* Notices
		* Invitations
		* IRC colors (receive only)
		* TLS connections to IRC servers
		* Channel listing
		* CTCP version and ping
		* Dynamic per-user, per-server configuration using XMPP ad-hoc
		commands and data-forms
		* Automatic sending of a command on connection (mostly used to
		send an identify message to NickServ or other authentication
		services)
		* Support for sending arbitrary IRC commands to a server
		* Embedded identd server
		* Message Archive Management support
